## 🐠 Bio-Inspiration

The robot design is inspired by the locomotion of:
- **Tuna** – high-speed propulsion
- **Clownfish** – agile movement in tight spaces
- **Goldfish** – simple efficient swimming
- **Golden Shiner** – steady directional flow
- **Rattlesnake** – ripple-like tail movement mechanism
